<h3 id="Gravity" </h3>

<p class="paragraph_text">
  Gravity is the force by which a planet or other body draws objects toward its
  center. The force of gravity keeps all of the planets in orbit around the sun.
  <br />
  <br />
  Why do you land on the ground when you jump up instead of floating off into
  space? Why do things fall down when you throw them or drop them? The answer is
  gravity: an invisible force that pulls objects toward each other. Earth's
  gravity is what keeps you on the ground and what makes things fall.
  <br />
  <br />
  Anything that has mass also has gravity. Objects with more mass have more
  gravity. Gravity also gets weaker with distance. So, the closer objects are to
  each other, the stronger their gravitational pull is.
  <br />
  <br />
  Earth's gravity comes from all its mass. All its mass makes a combined
  gravitational pull on all the mass in your body. That's what gives you weight.
  And if you were on a planet with less mass than Earth, you would weigh less
  than you do here.
